## Project: banking_system

#### Author: **Mahmoud Qunbor & Farah Eilouti**


#### _This project idea is to simulate the operations happening in the ATM system in the banks, mentioning the basics and most common services people make usually using the ATM machine._

#### _The program is made using object oriented programming, it provides a welcoming message with a display menu of the 6 options that can be tried, with results and respond-messages after every entry_

#### _**I made bug fixing** of the menu in which user won't be having errors because of mistakes in option-entry. which means if a user types "deposit" in the command line in a wrong spelling for example; he/she won't be having an error anymore. the program now will be working based on the numbers of the options._
